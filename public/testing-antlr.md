# antlr-ng Unit Tests

## Introduction

Unlike in ANLTR4 there's only one set of unit tests in <span class="antrlng">antlr-ng</span>: those for the tool itself. The original tool unit tests from ANTLR4 were translated to TypeScript and are running now as action on Github. To execute them locally, follow the same step as laid out in the [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started) and the [Building Section](/documentation/building). Download the repository (via git), install dependencies using `npm i` and then run the tests using

```bash
npm run test
```

which will give you:

```bash
> antlr-ng@1.0.4 test
> vitest --no-watch --no-coverage

All tool unit tests are located in the `tests/` folder. There are no runtime tests in the repository, since they are now the responsibility of the runtime projects.
